# Problem :
Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.
You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You 
must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.


## Example 1:
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"

## Example 2:
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"

## Example 3:
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"

## Algorithm :

- step1 : Get the two strings as named num1 and num2
- step2 : convert the two strings into the numbers and stored variables a and b
- step3 : add those numbers and stored into the variable add
- step4 : add a zero string in front of the add
- step5 : iterate the variable add with for loop
- step6 : stored the values in new variable
- step7 : print the trimmed value
